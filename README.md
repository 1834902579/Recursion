#  Recursion
##  There are just 3 steps to slove a problem Using Recursion .
 *Base case : Think of the simplest possible input for this function.*

 *Find the relation : Think how to large problem can be sloved with the help of
  the solution of the smalller problem.*
  
 *Generalise : Make a generalised function that slove the problem,
  put this all togather into a mathematical function or a tree.*
